# Checkpoint-Procedural-programming-Dot-Product : 
# Objective : 
Name: Dot product
Description: 
 -Write a procedure, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR)
 -Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
-Modify the previous algorithm if you use a dot_product function instead of a procedure.
# Instructions:
   -Use array for presenting the vector.
   -Use nested loop (a loop inside another)
   -Use different types of passing parameters
